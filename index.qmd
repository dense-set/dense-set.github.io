<p>I am Sarthak (he/him), a math grad student in his final year at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/). My advisor is the wonderful [Prof Gadadhar Misra](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~gm/), and we plan to do something functional-analytical for my Master's project.</p>
<p>Previously, in my undergrad days, I was a physics major at [St. Stehphen's College](https://www.ststephens.edu/). There, I took some pure math electives and had my first brush with *real* math. I immediately knew that the precision and rigor that math provided would be my solace. This led to my physics-to-math switch in 2021, and it was one of the most happy [(and dichotomously, tumultuous)]{style="font-size: 0.7em"} decisions I ever made.</p>
<p>I still haven't committed to anything particular in math. Nevertheless, I have enjoyed the "analytical" side of math a bit more than its "algebraic" side, and that could be due to my physics roots. [(Indeed, during my physics days, doing functional analysis rigorously (for QM) had been a goal.)]{style="font-size: 0.7em"} Nevertheless, I have eventually fallen for whatever I have studied so far, sometimes surprisingly (for instance, algebraic topology). Hence, I am still trying to gather as many tools in my kit as possible before taking the next step in my mathematical career.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">After all, isn't it the essence of math not to commit to a single perspective but to try looking at all sides? Wait, that's the [Yoneda perspective](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-yoneda-perspective), lol!</p>
