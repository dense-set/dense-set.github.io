I am Sarthak (he/him) and I recently completed my Master's in Math from [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/).

<p>Previously, in my undergrad days, I was a physics major at [St. Stehphen's College](https://www.ststephens.edu/). There, I took some pure math electives and had my first brush with *real* math. I immediately knew that the precision and rigor that math provided would be my solace. This led to my physics-to-math switch in 2021, and it was one of the most happy [(and dichotomously, tumultuous)]{style="font-size: 0.7em"} decisions I ever made.</p>

<p>Since then, I have eventually fallen for almost every kind of math that has crossed my path so far, sometimes surprisingly (for instance, algebraic topology). Nevertheless, I have enjoyed the "analytical" side of math a bit more than its "algebraic" side, and that could be due to my physics roots---real, complex and functional analyses all hold special places in my heart. [(Indeed, during my physics days, doing functional analysis rigorously (for QM) had been a goal.)]{style="font-size: 0.7em"} I also enjoy logic, and hold great respect for constructivists.</p>

Apart from doing math, my other observable states include playing piano, learning Italian, and crocheting.
